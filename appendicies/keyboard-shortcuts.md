# Keyboard Shortcuts

A list of keyboard shortcuts is also available by selecting File_/Key Bindings_ within xLights. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The shortcuts listed here are based on a Windows computer.  Other operating systems may vary somewhat.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Keyboard shortcuts are case sensitive.  If you are not getting the desired effect, check your Caps Lock.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
On occasion, the keybindings.xml file has been known to become corrupt and the keyboard shortcuts no longer function as intended.  If this occurs:

* Close xLights
* Go into your show directory
* Delete the keybindings.xml file
* Restart xLights

When xLights restarts, it will regenerate the keybindings.xml file to the default settings and the keyboard shortcuts should function again.
{% endhint %}

The following are the default keyboard presets.  These can be changed by the user by editing the keybindings.xml file if desired.

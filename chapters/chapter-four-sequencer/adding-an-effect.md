# Adding An Effect

## Adding an Effect

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (821).png>)

Click on the effect from the effects toolbar and drag the effect to the grid and release it between two timing marks on the row of the model you wish the effect to play on. You can then select and drag each end to stretch the duration of the effect or reduce the duration of the effect. The effect that you are working with is reflected in the (associated and open) windows to the left of the grid.

If no timing track is selected then you can drag and drop even if you have no timing marks but the effect defaults to 1 second long.

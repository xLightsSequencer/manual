### Perspectives

Perspectives saves the location and size of the "windows" you use.

Particularly for dual monitor setups, it lets you move and size the Preview and Color windows away, giving you a bigger program area. Going to View / Perspectives / Save Current will store your settings to the currently selected perspective.

You can have multiple perspective saved and easily recall them by selecting the perspective desired from the Perspectives window.

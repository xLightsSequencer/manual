Particularly for dual monitor setups, it lets you move and size the Preview and Color windows away, giving you a bigger program area. Going to View / Perspectives / Save Current will store your settings to the currently selected perspective.

You can have multiple perspective saved and easily recall them by selecting the perspective desired from the Perspectives window.

## Windows

There are a number of windows that enable simultaneous display of different views in xLights. When xLights first loads, a default set of windows are displayed. Which windows are open can be controlled via the Windows menu by selecting View, Windows and then clicking on the required window to open it. The window is dropped by default on the left side of the screen, however each window can be moved and docked to alternate locations on the same screen or moved to an alternate display screen if connected to your PC/ MAC.

For example, if you open this window against a morph effect, the windows will display a grid corresponding to the x,y coordinates. If you then grab a slider for the morph effect and move it, the Effect Assist window shows exactly where the coordinate is being moved to, making it easier to determine what is being done to the effect.

You can also grab a corner of the image in the Effect Assist window and move it and have the slider values update in real time.

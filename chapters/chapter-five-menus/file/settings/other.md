### eMail Address

### Exclude Presets From Packaged Sequences

If selected, when a sequence is packaged with the Package Sequence option, all effects presets are stripped from the xlights\_rgbeffects.xml file.

### Exclude Audio From Packaged Sequences

If selected, when a sequence is packaged the audio file is skipped as it is generally not legal to share audio files with other people. When the recipient opens the sequence they will need to point to where the audio file is on their computer.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If excluding the audio from a packaged sequence, it is necessary to provide the source of the audio file to those the package sequence is being sent to. This is best done by filling on the metadata on the sequence settings for the song, artist, album, and music URL (link for download).
{% endhint %}

### Video Export Settings

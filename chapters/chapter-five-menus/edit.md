## Edit

From the Edit menu , you can select the Undo, Cut, Copy and Paste functions and apply them where where applicable. As an example, when on the sequencer grid, you can highlight an effect, click Edit and then click on Copy (to copy the data to the clipboard). Move your cursor to where you want the effect to be duplicated and then click File and Paste.

You can also use the associated Ctrl keys instead i.e. Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V in this case. The functionality of each option is self explanatory.

### Shift Effects and Shift Selected Effects

These Options allow the user to shift or move the effects in a sequence. This is useful if the effects are not lining up with the music. This may be due to using a slightly different audio file or looking different on the actual physical lights as compared to that in xLights.

Note that the value entered is in milliseconds. 1 second is equal to 1000 milliseconds.

To shift the effects to the right, enter the number as a positive value. To shift the effects to the left, enter the number as a negative value.

Shifting effects works on both timing and effects.

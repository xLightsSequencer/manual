The xLights software will be installed in the destination location. In addition to the software required to run the application, the installer also installs a few useful utilities, dictionaries and a songs subdirectory. The xLights application software is installed by default in the xLights directory within your Windows Program Files directory ( C:\Program Files\xLights\\).

The location can be modified during the software install process by the user.

When xlights is installed, some browsers/virus scanners may flag the file and either prevent download or require you to provide extra assurances that you really want to download the file.

### Installing Queen Mary Vamp Plugins

If you do not have Audacity installed on your computer, then you should at least install the Queen Mary Vamp plugins for Audacity.

For the QM vamp plugin packages that can be installed without Audacity installed you will need to download two installers, the first is the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable([vc\_redist.x64.exe](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=52685)) and the second is the QM Vamp Plugins([Vamp\_Plugin64.exe](https://xlights.org/downloads/Vamp\_Plugin64.exe)). Both installer can be found at: [https://xlights.org/releases/](https://xlights.org/releases/). Run the "vc\_redist.x64.exe" installer first and then the "Vamp\_Plugin64.exe" installer.

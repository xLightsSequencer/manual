## &#x20;Testing

If you have a set of lights connected to your controller, you can test them directly via xLights.&#x20;

To ensure that the Controller channels and outputs setting match xLight, an Upload to Controller must be preformed. To do this, switch to the controller tab highlight the controller to test.

Click the 'Upload Input' and 'Upload Output' to configure the controller. 'Upload Input' must be preformed first. Some controller types do not require the 'Upload  Input' action to be preformed and this button may be grayed out. A dialog may appear asking the user to override the previous controller setting, Click 'Yes' on this dialog.

If you double Click on the Model Group name, it will expand and show you the models that have been defined as part of the Model group - in this case the ‘Arch 1’ model. Double Click again to collapse the Model Group.

This is effectively placing the effect on the model.

You could also place it against the Model Group - (one line higher), in which case it applies to all models under the Group.

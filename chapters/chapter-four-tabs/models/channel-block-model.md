### # Channels

Number(#) of Channels defines the size of the channel block. These Individual channels can then be used to control specific channels on a device or controller.&#x20;

### Channel Color

Channel Color determines what color in the sequencer will "activate" this channel block channel. If set to 'White' all three RGB channel values will be use to set the output channel value. If set to 'Red' only the Red channel values will be use to set the output channel value.

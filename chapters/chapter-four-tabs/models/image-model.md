# Image Model

### Image Model

![Image Model](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (641).png>)

The Image Model is used to represent single channel props like blow-molds, inflatables or incandescent cutouts/wire-frames. You load a picture of the prop and xLights will illuminate the picture based on the channel value. The Off brightness can be set to a value above zero(10% in the example) so it is still visible in the layout when the channel is off. This Model only works with Single Channel or Single Channel Intensity string types not RGB lights or pixels.

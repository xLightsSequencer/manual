The Morph effect creates a Movement across a model of one or many strands of lights with a head and tail. The Morph effect looks best on mega trees, arches and matrix models but is not limited to those models.

In the Color selection there can be from 1 to 8 colors used for the morph. The color selection is from left to right. If one color is selected the whole morph will be that color. If two colors are selected the Head will be set to the first selected color and the Tail with the second selected color.

If three colors are selected the Head will morph from color1 to color2 then will morph to Color 3. If more than 3 colors are selected then the tail will continue to morph from color3 to color4 to color 5 to color 6. Note if you only want the tail to morph then set color1 and color2 to the same color. If a color gradient color is used then the color morphing can be almost infinite.

A morph can start anywhere and end anywhere on a model. The starting and ending locations are specified by the X,Y coordinates on the Start/End tabs.

| **Show Head at Start**                                                | When used with the stagger option, the head of each morph will show prior to the morph moving based on the stagger interval.                                                          |

{% hint style="success" %}
Open and use the Effect Assist window. The window will display a grid corresponding to the x,y start and end coordinates. If you then grab a slider for the morph effect and move it, the Effect Assist window shows exactly where the coordinate is being moved to, making it easier to determine what is being done to the effect. Double click to reset the coordinates to defaults.

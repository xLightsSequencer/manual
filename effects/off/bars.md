The Bars effect creates straight edged multiple color bars that move across a model. The edges may be hard, highlighted or 3D (soft).

| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Palette Rep**          | <p>Number of times the color palette repeats on a model. All the colors selected will repeat as many times as this value is defined.</p><p>Therefore , if 2 colors are selected and this value is 3, each of the 2 colors will come on 3 times , resulting in 6 changes of colors.<br></p><p>This whole setting is multiplied by the Cycles value.</p><p>Can be adjusted via the Value Curves options.</p> |
| **Cycles**               | <p>Number of cycles for the duration.<br></p><p>Therefore</p><ul><li>If set to 1, then the colors selected and palette rep combination will execute once.</li><li>If set to 2 and there are 3 colors and the palette rep is set to 4 , then there will be 24 changes of color (2 cycles * (3 colors * 4 reps) ) in the selected duration.</li></ul><p>Can be adjusted via the Value Curves options.</p>    |
| **Center Point**         | Enables you to control where the center point is for expand and compress (both vertical and horizontal).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Direction UP/DOWN**    | Bars move UP or DOWN a model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Direction Expand**     | Bars start at the center and move outward towards the top and bottom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Direction Compress**   | Bars start at the top and bottom edges of a model and move to the center.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Direction Left/Right** | Bars start at the left/right edges of the model and move to the other side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Direction H Expand**   | Bars start at the horizontal middle of the model and expand towards the left and right edges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Direction H Compress** | Bars start at the left/right edges of the model and move in towards the horizontal center of the model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Direction Alternate**  | Bars are not animated like the other direction options. The colors for each bar change to the next color selected in the palette.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Highlight**            | A single row of white is set at the leading edge of each color.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **3D**                   | The trailing edge of each color fades to black.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Gradient**             | When selected, causes the different colors to merge into each other as a gradient rather than as a sharp change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

{% hint style="success" %}
Layering a On effect with a start intensity of 0% and ending of 100% will result in a ramp up, as opposed to an On effect with hard edges. Be sure to set the blending option of the On effect to “layer 1 is mask”. Make sure the cycle count is set to 1, and you have a color selected (doesn't matter which color since it's a mask).

The Piano effect displays a piano keyboard effects where the keys modulate based on the beat and frequency of the sequence audio. In addition to generating the effect using xLights inbuilt capability to process sound waves , you can also use an externally created Polyphonic Transcription notes file or an external midi file.

Then, expand the view so that you can see the labels of the timing track and change the labels to match the required keys. The label can be the key letter or can be the MIDI value of the key.

You can also specify multiple values in one label and accordingly multiple keys will be depressed.

You can use a value of C# to depress the C# key , C to depress the C key or multiple values such as C F A to depress three keys.

Multiple key formats are supported:

* 1-127: midi codes
* C4 or c#4: note and octave
*   C or C#: notes (assumed to be 4th octave)

    Keys are separated by space, comma or colons.

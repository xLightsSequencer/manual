The Shimmer effect provides an effect whereby the lights rapidly turn on and off. One or multiple colors can be used for the effect.

| Option/Settings    | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Duty Factor**    | Defines what percentage of the total cycle the lights will shimmer on. For the rest of the time in the cycle, they will be off.  Can be adjusted via the Value Curves options. |
| **Cycle Count**    | Defines the number of cycles (shimmer on, followed by an off period) that will be repeated in the timeframe of the effect.  Can be adjusted via the Value Curves options.      |
| **Use All Colors** | If checked, then the Shimmer effect generates a pulse rather than a shimmer with the selected colors pulsing off and on in sequence.                                           |

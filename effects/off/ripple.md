The Ripple effect generates a ripple like spreading movement of color similar to when an object is dropped into water. One or multiple colors can be used for the effect.

| Option/Settings    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Object to Draw** | Defines the shape of the object that will ripple. The Circle is the default and the most commonly selected value. A Square, Triangle, Star, Polygon, Heart, Tree, Candy Cane, Snow Flake, Crucifix(Cross), and Present shape can also be selected. |
| **Movement**       | Defines the direction of the ripple i.e. Explode (Outwards) and Implode (Inwards).                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Thickness**      | <p>Controls the thickness of each line of the ripple.</p><p>Can be adjusted via the Value Curves options.</p>                                                                                                                                      |
| **Cycle Count**    | Defines the number of cycles that the shape should explode/implode within the given time frame of the effect. Can be adjusted via the Value Curves options.                                                                                        |
| **Points**         | Number of Points/Sides of the Shape, Only available on Star, Snow Flake, and Polygon.                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Rotation**       | Rotation of the shape.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **3D**             | Indicates whether the ripple effect should render as is a 3D or 2D effect.                                                                                                                                                                         |

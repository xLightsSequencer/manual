{% hint style="danger" %}
If you move the image that you have used for the video effect to a different location or delete it, when you next run the sequencer, if the image is not found, an error message will not be displayed, but the effect will render a blank image. The only time this wonâ€™t happen is if only the drive letter has changed, and the rest of the path is the same.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the Video Effect is appearing as a "Red" video, the video effect cannot find the video file.

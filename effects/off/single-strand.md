The Single Strand effect is an effect that is used to implement chases and other such staggered effects on models that are single dimensional in nature such as house outlines, arches as well as AC models.

| **Skips: Starting Position**  | Used to define the starting position of the first part of the strand that will be on. Advancing this value advances the component of the strand that will first turn on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Skips: Number of Advances** | This defines the relative value of the number of units that the effect will skip before turning on. A value of zero will force the effect to be stationary in one position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Skips: Direction**          | Defines the direction of the skip i.e. Left, right, From Middle or To Middle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

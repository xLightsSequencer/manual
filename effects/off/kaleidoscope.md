The Kaleidoscope Effect is a canvas mode effect. By itself it does nothing. It must be placed above another effect and it will modify the output. A Kaleidoscope will sample a section of the underlying effect and mirror it into a symmetrical pattern. A "Square" kaleidoscope type will use a square shaped sample area and a triangle type will use a triangle shaped area. The "Size" , "Center X", and "Center Y" determines the location/size of the sampling area.

The Twinkle effect provides an effect of individual particles turning off and on slowly or rapidly, similar to the shimmer effect but with a different and more random implementation. One or multiple colors can be used for the effect.

| **Re-Randomize after Tinkle** | When multiple colors are selected and option checked, the effect randomizes the colors displayed versus being in a defined order.              |

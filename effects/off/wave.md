The Wave effect generates a waveform effect across the model. Different types of waveforms are possible as described below. One or multiple colors can be used for the effect.

| Option/Settings          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Wave Type**            | Defines the type of waveform to be generated by the effect: Sine, Decaying Sine, Square, Triangle, Fractal/Ivy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Fill colors**          | <p>Defines the color of color selection to be used for the waveform.</p><p>If ‘None’ is selected, only the first color selected is used.</p><p>If ‘Palette’ is selected, then the colors selected from the color palette are used.</p><p>If ‘Rainbow’ is selected, then the colors selected from are from the rainbow palette.</p> |
| **Mirror Wave**          | If this setting is selected, a mirror image of the waveform is also generated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Number of Waves**      | <p>Controls the formation of the speed at which the waves are formed.</p><p>Can be adjusted via the Value Curves options.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Thickness of Wave**    | <p>Controls the thickness of the waveform.</p><p>If multiple colors have been selected, as the thickness increases, then the different colors form part of the waveform.</p><p>For a thin wave, the first color selected is used.</p><p>Can be adjusted via the Value Curves options.</p>                                          |
| **Scale Height of Wave** | <p>Defines the height of the waveform.</p><p>Can be adjusted via the Value Curves options.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Speed**                | <p>Controls the speed at which the wave moves across in the specified direction.</p><p>Can be adjusted via the Value Curves options.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Wave Direction**       | Defines whether the wave moves from Left to Right or Right to Left.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Y Offset**             | Adjust the Y location of the wave on the screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The Color Wash effect creates a wash effect of the selected color or colors across the model. Can be effective if multiple colors are selected and the effect is used as a background effect.

One or multiple colors can be used for the effect. If multiple colors are selected, then the ColorWash will use the selected colors repeating the colors depending on the ‘count’ setting.

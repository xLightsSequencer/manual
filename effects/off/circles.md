The Circles effect creates solid sphere like objects that move seemingly in random fashion on a model.

Used most effectively on models such as a mega tree or a matrix. One or multiple colors can be used for the effect. If multiple colors are selected, than the circles will be made up of the selected colors.

| **Number of Circles** | <p>Number of circles that displays on a model.</p><p>Can be adjusted via the Value Curves options.</p>         |
| **Size**              | <p>The size of each circle of the effect. </p><p>Can be adjusted via the Value Curves options.</p>             |
| **Speed**             | <p>The speed at which the circles move on the effect. </p><p>Can be adjusted via the Value Curves options.</p> |
| **Bounce**            | The effect creates a noticeable bounce up and down of the circles.                                             |
| **Radial**            | The circles stretch outwards and back radially.                                                                |
| **Plasma**            | The circle edges blend into each other. Increase the number of circles for this value to be effective.         |
| **Radial 3D**         | The circles stretch outwards and back radially.                                                                |
| **Bubbles**           | Each circle displays an outline rather than being solid in color.                                              |
| **Linear Fade**       | Causes each circle to blur and have its edges fade to black.                                                   |

{% hint style="success" %}
Place the effect to initially span at least a few seconds. After placing the effect on the model, adjust the number of circles and the speed down until the circles can be seen moving around and then adjust upwards as required.

{% hint style="success" %}
Place the Circles effect on a star and select the Radial option to obtain a nice looking effect.

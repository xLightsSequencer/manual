# Moving Head

### Position Tab

\
Grid: The grid can be used to quickly change the Pan and Tilt values. You will see the slider update as you move.\
Pan: This will pan all selected heads. This also works as an offset to any other commands like Fan and a Path.\
Tilt: This will tilt all selected heads. This also works as an offset to any other commands like Fan and a Path.\
Fan Pan: This sets the number of degrees to fan each head in the pan direction.\
Fan Tilt: This sets the number of degrees to fan each head in the tilt direction.\
Groupings: Divides the selected heads into groups of 1 through 6. So if you have 8 heads with a grouping of 2 then the first\
4 heads will fan and the second 4 heads will fan. Heads 1 and 5 will point the same direction and so on.\
Cycles: Change the motion speed of a head.\
Presets: Presets can be saved and an icon will be created to quickly recall those settings. It will try to draw a representation\
of the angle the heads are pointing and their colors.

### Pathing Tab

\
Draw paths the same way as the Sketch effect. I had to make some improvements to allow a path to close properly.\
Scale: You can draw a circle and then use the Scale slider to make the head move in a smaller or larger circle.\
Time Offset: This will stagger each selected head so they aren't all in the same position on the path.\
Ignore Pan: Ignores the pan part of the path\
Ignore Tilt: Ignores the tilt part of the path\
Presets: Presets can be saved and an icon is generated that can be clicked to quickly recall the path settings.

### Control Tab

#### Color Tab

\
Click anywhere in the color circle to select a color for all selected heads.\
You can click and drag the circle around to change the color.\
If you Shift-Left click you can define additional circles and a number appears inside the circle.\
Multiple circles will cause the effect to do a colorwash through the selected colors.\
Click a circle and press the delete key to remove one.\
The color bar at the bottom can be used to dial down the brightness of the selected color.
